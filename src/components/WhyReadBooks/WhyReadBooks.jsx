              Why Reading Books is Important
            </h1>
            <article className="py-6">
              <h2>1. Knowledge Expansion</h2>
              <p>
                Reading books exposes you to a wide range of knowledge, allowing
                you to learn about different subjects, cultures, and
                perspectives.
              </p>
              <h2>2. Mental Stimulation</h2>
              <p>
                Engaging with books keeps your brain active and healthy,
                improving cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive
                decline.
              </p>
              <h2>3. Vocabulary Enhancement</h2>
              <p>
                Reading regularly helps you build a rich vocabulary, which can
                improve communication skills and comprehension abilities.
              </p>
              <h2>4. Stress Reduction</h2>
              <p>
                Immersing yourself in a good book can provide a temporary escape
                from the stresses of daily life, promoting relaxation and
                reducing stress levels.
              </p>
              <h2>5. Empathy Development</h2>
              <p>
                Reading fiction allows you to step into the shoes of diverse
                characters and understand their experiences, fostering empathy
                and compassion.
              </p>
              <h2>6. Entertainment and Enjoyment</h2>
              <p>
                Beyond the educational benefits, reading is a source of pleasure
                and entertainment, offering endless opportunities for enjoyment
                and enrichment.
